THE JOURNEY
--

For my capstone project for my Software Engineering Immersive course, I decided to undertake building the app that I had always wanted to build. 
From the first day that I joined this course, I knew that this would be my final course project, and I am glad that I was able to use the technologies learnt during the entire 3 mth bootcamp.

I started with building the backend first, setting up my initial databases, models, routes, validators before working on the front end. 
For the frontend, I chose to work with ANTD as I wanted to try a new design framework, other than the Bootstrap which I was accustomed to. 

BACKEND
--
I had 3 major categories to build for my backend to ensure my frontend was working.

1. Authentication - to authenticate users whilst registering, logging in and logging out
2. User Settings - this will store all the user data from their fav/non-fav cuisines, dietary restrictions, visited locations, etc
3. Restaurant Settings - this will store all the restaurants data and aid in the filtering process during the front end call. 

FRONTEND
--

Several components and pages were built to ensure that the users will get the full experience. Again it targeted the 3 main categories of Authentication, User Settings and Meal Settings.

IN THE FUTURE
--

In the future, I would like to add these additional features:
- More responsive design to fit any screen
- Improve on layout quality and design
- More refinement of the filters when more data is entered
- Cleaner codes
- Try out recreating the app using a different programming language for both front and back end
- Additional features such as linking with connections (others who are using the same app, so that their info will be collated to provide a refined restaurant result)
- Cashback/Vouchers - for taking it into the real world, this would allow users to receive cashback, vouchers, rewards, discounts for using the app
